Files
=====

Before we can begin making a video, we need to import files into OpenShot.
Most media file types are recognized, such as videos, images, and audio files.
Files can be viewed and managed in the **Project Files** panel.

Import Files

There are many ways to import media files into OpenShot.

Split Clip
----------
If you need to cut a file into many smaller clips before editing,
the **Split Clip** dialog is built exactly for this purpose.
Right click on a file, and choose
:menuselection:`--> Split Clip…` from the context menu.
This opens the **Split Clip** dialog.
Use this dialog to quickly cut out as many small clips as you need.
The dialog stays open after you create a clip,
to allow you to repeat the steps for your next clip.
When you are finished, simply close the dialog.

       (This also resets the **Split Clip** dialog,

Add to Timeline
---------------
In certain cases, you might need to add many files to the timeline at the same time.
For example, a photo slide show, or a large number of short video clips.
The **Add to Timeline** dialog can automate this task for you.
First, select all files you need to add, right click,
and choose :menuselection:`--> Add to Timeline`.

Properties
----------
To view the properties of any imported file in your video project,
right click on the file and choose :menuselection:`--> File Properties`.
This will launch the **File Properties** dialog,
which displays information about your media file.
For certain types of images (i.e. image sequences),
you can adjust the frame rate on this dialog also.
